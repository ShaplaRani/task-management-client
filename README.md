###  At least five  different features and functionalities of my website is giving below.

*  Users can create new tasks with titles, descriptions, deadlines, and priority levels (e.g., low, moderate, high).Utilize React Hook Form for task creation. Tasks are categorized into three lists: to-do, ongoing, and completed. Implement drag-and-drop functionality, allowing users to move tasks between lists for easy task management.

* Users can edit existing task details. Provide an edit button for each task. Clicking the button enables users to modify task details and save the changes. Users can also delete tasks, but this action requires logging in to the task management dashboard.

* Users receive notifications for task assignments, updates, and deadlines.Implement toast notifications that appear in real-time when a task is assigned, updated, or when a deadline is approaching. Notifications enhance user awareness and keep them informed about changes in their tasks.

* The website implements user registration and login functionality with email and password-based authentication. Users can create accounts, log in, and toggle between the login and registration views. Error messages are displayed if there are issues with passwords, emails, or login attempts.
In addition to email and password-based authentication, the website offers  one additional login method, such as using social media accounts like   Google. This provides users with alternative login options for convenience.

* After logging in, users can see their username, profile picture, and a logout button in the website's header. Clicking the logout button allows users to securely log out of their accounts.
